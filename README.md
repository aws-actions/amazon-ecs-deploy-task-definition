## Amazon ECS "Deploy Task Definition" Action for GitHub Actions

Registers an Amazon ECS task definition and deploys it to an ECS service.

## Usage

```yaml
    - name: Deploy to Amazon ECS
      uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-deploy-task-definition@v1
      with:
        task-definition: task-definition.json
        service: my-service
        cluster: my-cluster
        wait-for-service-stability: true
```

The action can be passed a `task-definition` generated dynamically via [the `aws-actions/amazon-ecs-render-task-definition` action](https://github.com/aws-actions/amazon-ecs-render-task-definition).

## Credentials and Region

This action relies on the [default behavior of the AWS SDK for Javascript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html) to determine AWS credentials and region.
Use [the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials) to configure the GitHub Actions environment with environment variables containing AWS credentials and your desired region.

We recommend following [Amazon IAM best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) for the AWS credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows, including:
* Do not store credentials in your repository's code.  You may use [GitHub Actions secrets](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) to store credentials and redact credentials from GitHub Actions workflow logs.
* [Create an individual IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#create-iam-users) with an access key for use in GitHub Actions workflows, preferably one per repository. Do not use the AWS account root user access key.
* [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) to the credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows.  Grant only the permissions required to perform the actions in your GitHub Actions workflows.  See the Permissions section below for the permissions required by this action.
* [Rotate the credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#rotate-credentials) used in GitHub Actions workflows regularly.
* [Monitor the activity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#keep-a-log) of the credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows.

## Permissions

This action requires the following minimum set of permissions:

```
{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Sid":"RegisterTaskDefinition",
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition"
         ],
         "Resource":"*"
      },
      {
         "Sid":"PassRolesInTaskDefinition",
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "iam:PassRole"
         ],
         "Resource":[
            "arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:role/<task_definition_task_role_name>",
            "arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:role/<task_definition_task_execution_role_name>"
         ]
      },
      {
         "Sid":"DeployService",
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "ecs:UpdateService",
            "ecs:DescribeServices"
         ],
         "Resource":[
            "arn:aws:ecs:<region>:<aws_account_id>:service/<cluster_name>/<service_name>"
         ]
      }
   ]
}
```

Note: the policy above assumes the account has opted in to the ECS long ARN format.

## AWS CodeDeploy Support

For ECS services that uses the `CODE_DEPLOY` deployment controller, additional configuration is needed for this action:

```yaml
    - name: Deploy to Amazon ECS
      uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-deploy-task-definition@v1
      with:
        task-definition: task-definition.json
        service: my-service
        cluster: my-cluster
        wait-for-service-stability: true
        codedeploy-appspec: appspec.json
        codedeploy-application: my-codedeploy-application
        codedeploy-deployment-group: my-codedeploy-deployment-group
```

The minimal permissions require access to CodeDeploy:

```
{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Sid":"RegisterTaskDefinition",
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition"
         ],
         "Resource":"*"
      },
      {
         "Sid":"PassRolesInTaskDefinition",
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "iam:PassRole"
         ],
         "Resource":[
            "arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:role/<task_definition_task_role_name>",
            "arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:role/<task_definition_task_execution_role_name>"
         ]
      },
      {
         "Sid":"DeployService",
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "ecs:DescribeServices",
            "codedeploy:GetDeploymentGroup",
            "codedeploy:CreateDeployment",
            "codedeploy:GetDeployment",
            "codedeploy:GetDeploymentConfig",
            "codedeploy:RegisterApplicationRevision"
         ],
         "Resource":[
            "arn:aws:ecs:<region>:<aws_account_id>:service/<cluster_name>/<service_name>",
            "arn:aws:codedeploy:<region>:<aws_account_id>:deploymentgroup:<application_name>/<deployment_group_name>",
            "arn:aws:codedeploy:<region>:<aws_account_id>:deploymentconfig:*",
            "arn:aws:codedeploy:<region>:<aws_account_id>:application:<application_name>"
         ]
      }
   ]
}
```
